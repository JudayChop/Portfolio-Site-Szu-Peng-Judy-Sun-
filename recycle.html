                    <h2>Objective</h2>
                    <p>reCYCLE is an e-commerce mobile app and responsive web app that aims to create a hassle-free online shopping experience for cyclists to buy and sell used gears. The target audience is between the ages of 20s and 40s, who enjoy cycling as a way of commuting to work, mountain biking in nature, road racing, or simply as a hobby.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>Cycling enthusiasts today usually have to go to major sporting goods stores or other general e-commerce sites to shop and sell their bike gears. Other similar platforms made specifically for used bike gear do exist but the user experience is still lacking. This can cause frustrations because the users would have to go to various places in order to find what they’re looking for. <br>reCYCLE’s simple and sleek design will create a better user experience for cyclists who want to buy or sell used gear online. reCYCLE will also become the go-to platform for their cycling related needs. </p>
                    <h2>Approach</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><u>User flow</u> - based on user stories </li>
                        <li><u>Wireframes</u> - low, mid, and high-fidelity wireframes</li>
                        <li><u>User testing and feedback</u> - user testing on key user flow through mid-fidelity wireframes prototype</li>
                        <li><u>Final user interface designs and mockup</u> - gathered user feedback and applied to final design</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div>
                        <h2>My Role</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>UI Designer</li>
                            <li>UX Designer</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Tools Used</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Figma</li>
                            <li>Balsamiq</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h2>User Flows</h2>
                    <p>User flows are based off of the following user stories:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>As a new customer, I want to access the inventory without having to register, so that I can make sure this store has what I’m looking for before having to create an account.</li>
                        <li>As a customer, I want to be able to place multiple items in a shopping cart, so that I can purchase more than one item at a time.</li>
                        <li>As a returning customer, I want to be able to save items that I cannot buy to a wish list, so that I can purchase them at a later date.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Wireframes (low-fidelity)</h2>
                    <p>I started sketching some wireframes based off of the user flows, starting with the loading screen, home page, process of searching for a product, adding items to the wishlist, and a checkout popup.</p>

                    <h2>Wireframes (mid-fidelity)</h2>
                    <p>I started sketching some wireframes based off of the user flows, starting with the loading screen, home page, process of searching for a product, adding items to the wishlist, and a checkout popup.</p>

                    <h2>User Testing (Usability)</h2>
                    <p>The goal of this test is to assess if new users can successfully complete their scenario while interacting with the mobile application for the first time. I would like to observe and measure if new users understand the project, its value, and how to complete basic initial functions such as searching for a product, adding a product to a wishlist and shopping cart.</p>
                    <p><u>Scenario:</u>You are a new user, and would like to search for some "handlebars" and browse the inventory available. After you reach the search results, you would like to save the 2nd and 3rd items to your wishlist. After reviewing your wishlist, you would like to add both items to your cart and check out.</p>

                    <h2>Wireframes (high-fidelity)</h2>
                    <p>After analyzing my user testing results, I considered the possible solutions to the pain points and edited my high-fidelity wireframes accordingly. I included a number indicator for the shopping cart when an item is added.  I created additional screens including a log in screen, an additional pop-up shopping cart on the search results page, and a shopping cart page. I also removed the heart icon for “save your search” and also included a Saved Searches tab within the page with the wishlist items.</p>

                    <h2>Challenges</h2>
                    <p>One of the challenges of creating reCYCLE is how to differentiate us from other competitors. I spent a lot of time defining the branding guidelines to set ourselves apart. Also following the client’s needs, my designs needed to be modern and clean while providing the users with an easy online shopping experience. I used simple layouts and designs while providing useful features like saving an item to a wishlist, filtering and sorting search results, saving a search, etc.</p>

                    <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                    <p>I was not very familiar with bike parts and gear prior to this project. So I spent some more time researching and consulting friends that goes cycling on the regular.  Throughout this project, I learned:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to build a cohesive brand based on a given design brief, defining a branding guideline</li>
                        <li>Sticking to the principle that “less is more” and focused on functionalism rather than elaborate design</li>
                        <li>Utilize my UX design skills to create user flows and wireframes</li>
                        <li>Learned a new prototyping tool Balsamiq and used it for my user testing</li>
                        <li>Learned to be more open to listen to user feedback and not take anything personal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>What I would do differently next time is to perform another user testing on my final design to make sure the design is aligned with my intention to solve the user’s problems. On a second iteration I would use user feedback and improve my designs. I would also dive in deeper into other features like the community forum.</p>
